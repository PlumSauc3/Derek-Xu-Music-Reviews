        "Lorde's newest album is full of emotional performances and chilling lyrics. As before, Lorde is able to create beautiful atmospheres through the use of very simple, but impactful instrumental backings. Her lyrics are often very relatable, allowing her to connect deeply with the listener. Despite the sad, reflective music though, this album is still incredibly catchy",

        "Bonito Generation is a wonderful pop music album. It features amazingly positive, fun, lighthearted lyrics. KKB has a special sound, mixing Japanese style synth instrumentals with vocals in both English and Japanese. The songs are so catchy and deliver such heartwarming messages, you can't help but sing along!",

        "Fleet Foxes' newest album is wonderful. As before, they use an extremely large variety of instruments and styles, each perfectly suiting the atmosphere of the song. Each song can undergo drastic changes in volume and style. The songs feature the elaborate folk metaphors that have come from Fleet Foxes in the past. The songwriting is brilliant. They deal with serious, sensitive matters such as police brutality, how people treat one another and the future of the world.",

        "Many view OK Computer as the best album ever created and it is certainly one of my favourites. It features songs with great lyrics and captivating instrumental atmospheres. The haunting vocals cut through the simple - but beautiful - instrumentals and create an extremely enjoyable experience. Songs vary in subject matter but each is an equally chilling performance.",

        "Kanye's first few projects are my favourite, with College Dropout being slightly better than Late Registration. At point Kanye had already built his reputation as a producer, and it shows. The beats draw influences from many different styles sampling lots of great oldschool vocals and jazz instrumentals. Although the overarching story on this album is about how everyone is obsessed with going to college, Kanye also touches on materialsm, religion, working retail and other touching stories about his own life. Definitely one my favourite projects.",

        "Helplessness Blues is an amazing record. As the title suggests, Robin Pecknold sings about not knowing what to do with his life, inspecting his choices so far. Each song is a story, featuring a wide range of dynamics and constantly changing instrumentals. The atmosphere created by the music perfectly compliments the masterful lyrics."
