        "Lorde's newest album is full of emotional performances and chilling lyrics. As before, Lorde is able to create beautiful atmospheres through the use of very simple, but impactful instrumental backings. Her lyrics are often very relatable, allowing her to connect deeply with the listener. Despite the sad, reflective music though, this album is still incredibly catchy"
